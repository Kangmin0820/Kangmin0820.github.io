Hi! I'm Kangmin Choi, an undergraduate student studying **Statistics** at **Fudan University**. I'm currently conducting research as an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the **FNLP Lab**, advised by **Prof. Xipeng Qiu**. [Get my CV here](/assets/pdf/Resume_Kangmin Choi.pdf).

My research interests lie in Deep learning theory, Optimization and Reinforcement Learning. I ultmately aim to be a researcher who **bridge the gap between theory and practice**.
